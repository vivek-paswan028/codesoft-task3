          Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (1891â€“1956) was a jurist, economist, politician, and social reformer. Born into a family subjected to untouchability, he rose to become one of the most influential figures in Indian history. His relentless pursuit of justice, education, and equality transformed the lives of millions and continues to inspire generations.
